Gustus et Fauna is a personal culinary blog created by Babi, born out of a deep love for flavor and technique. In my family, food has always been prepared fresh, with the secret ingredient being the love of the chef. Growing up surrounded by this culture of nutritious, savory meals, I developed a passion that I now wish to share with you.

Through food, the most beautiful and delicious way to show someone how much they mean to you, I hope to bring a smile of satisfaction to you and your loved ones.

Along the way, I'll also highlight the talented chefs and bakers who have influenced my skills and favorite recipes, so you can explore their work as well. 

The final dedication goes to the person without whom this blog would never have been possible —my willing food guinea pig and tech-savvy man. It's no secret that this blog owes more to your technical skills than mine, and for that, I'm deeply grateful.

Bon Appétit !
